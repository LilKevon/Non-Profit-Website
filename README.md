# Non-Profit-Website
Non-Profit-Website: As the sole Front End Developer at my Non-Profit, I created and developed a website for my organization in order to garner more attention. As of 2022-05-19, we have 9 students, and we are only gaining more. This is the source code for my non profit. It includes alot of mistakes and verbose code, due to it being my first ever attempt to create a website.
